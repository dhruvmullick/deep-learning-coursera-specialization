# deep-learning-coursera-specialization
Programming Assignments for some of the Coursera Deep Learning Specialisation Modules

1. Week 1 -> Using Tensorflow, build a convolutional neural network (CNN) by implementing Conv layers, Pool layers and Forward propagation.
2. Week 2 -> Using Keras, build a model for Residual Neural Networks (ResNet)
3. Week 3 -> Using Keras, use YOLO with non-max suppression algorithm for object detection.
